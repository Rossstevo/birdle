##  What is it? 

A simple game where users guess a famous person based on squares being revealed. 

## Why is it called Birdle?

I initially wanted to make it for birds before realising the market was too small 

## What did you make it with?

I used Vanilla JS. I wanted to launch the game quickly so I used vanilla JS. React would have been better but my React de-bugging is not as hot as my JS. This turned out to be a good decision because once the site went live, I needed to do a lot of quick de-bugging
I am hosting the site on Netlify. 

## What features does it have?

- Dark mode
- share to Twitter/Facebook
- instructions 


## What have I learned?

Loads! 
1. Coding
I have learnt a lot about coding in Javascript. Coding quickly, effectively, and clearly. I'll admit when I started this I was certainly not the most detailed person. But now, I really see the benefit of taking time to make sure things are done right. I'm also now convinced that React would have been better. My code is repetative and the components feature of React would have made this far simpler. 

2. Hosting a website
I've never hosted a website before this and it is great fun. It feels like the site is alive. I am learning about SEO and how Google works. 

3. UX/UI
MY UX/UI skills are not great, I am designing the website as I go and there is no plan, wireframe or diagram. This means I can implement ideas quickly but it also means I'm relying on peers to tell me if something doesn't look/feel very good. 



## failures?

Commits. When the pressure hits, I am not being specific enough with my commit messages.
Pushing to master. Self explanatory. I have resolved this now. 

## coolest feature?

The tile-reveal formular was a fun problem to solve and ended up being pretty simple. I made an array of variables [tiles14, tile7, tile22, tile 16, tile 1]. When the user clicks 'peep' the first item in the array is used then discarded. Each day I set the array based on which tiles I think will make the game interesting. 

## Where I need help...
The Whatsapp score-sharing feature is pretty confusing (my solution is long winded but it works). I can't insert a span into the href so I had to write different href tags and use an if statement to hide/reveal each tag. If anyone can help please let me know.
